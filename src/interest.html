        <h3>Drawing</h3>
       <img src="../images/interests/banner-img.jpg" alt="banner-drawing">
        <p>
          I love sketching it's always been a way for me to bring the characters
          I create to life and a way to represent the world. Creating
          characters, landscapes, and abstract designs helps me relax and sparks
          my creativity. Through drawing, I've developed a deeper appreciation for the details and beauty in the world around me. My sketches often reflect the emotions I feel or the stories I want to tell, making each piece uniquely personal.

  <h3>Manga</h3>
  <p>
    Reading manga, which is comics made in Japan, has always been a source of inspiration for me, with its incredible storytelling and breathtaking art. Series like One Piece and Attack on Titan have left a lasting impression, teaching me about resilience and emotional depth. I especially love action-packed stories and heartfelt romances that explore deep themes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of my favorite creators include Eiichiro Oda for his brilliant world-building in One Piece. His works inspire me to dream about creating my own story someday—a mix of fantasy and reality with strong emotional connections. My love for drawings and art was also influenced by their incredibly creative works.

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <img src="../images/interests/philosophy-img-1.jpg" alt="philosophy">
        <p>
          Philosophy captivates me because it challenges me to think critically
          and ask big questions about life, existence, and morality. I’ve
          enjoyed exploring existentialist ideas from thinkers like Sartre and
          Nietzsche, which have influenced how I approach challenges. Philosophy
          not only sharpens my reasoning but also inspires me to seek meaning in
          my work and relationships.
