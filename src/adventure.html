            <h3>Exploring the National Museum of Ethiopia</h3>
            <p><time datetime="2024-11-15">November 15, 2024</time></p>

          <p>
            Not long after I joined Addis Ababa University that is located at 5
            kilo branch, I learned the national museum of Ethiopia is located
            around there and I didn't waste my time to find out what it holds as
            Interest in history. And as I thought it really
            didn't disappoint it was a place that beautifully preserves
            Ethiopia's rich cultural and historical heritage. Walking through
            the halls, I was immediately drawn to the museum's most famous
            exhibit: Lucy (Dinkinesh), the fossilized remains of a
            3.2-million-year-old ancestor. Standing in front of her, I felt a
            deep connection to humanity's shared history.

          <p>
            The museum also showcased stunning artifacts, ancient manuscripts,
            and traditional Ethiopian art. I spent a lot of time admiring the
            vibrant paintings and intricate sculptures that told stories of the
            country's past. Each piece seemed to whisper tales of kings, queens,
            and traditions long gone yet still alive in spirit.

            It was a sunny day when my parents decided to take our family to
            kuriftu water park, Located in Bishoftu, just a short drive from
            Addis Ababa.though we didn't know at the time. I was not that
            interested at first but we still went their and it turns out to be
            one of the best times of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I entered, I was greeted by the vibrant energy of the park. The
            sparkling pools, colorful slides, and cheerful laughter of visitors
            set the tone for a day filled with joy. I started with the lazy
            river, a gentle and relaxing ride that let me drift along while
            enjoying the park's beautiful landscape.

           The highlight of my visit was the wave pool, where I felt like I was at the beach, enjoying the artificial waves crashing against me. For a thrill, I ventured onto the giant water slides, where each twist and turn left me exhilarated and ready for more.

        One evening, my family and I decided to visit Chanoly Restaurant, a place famous for its Japanese cuisine. As someone who has always been fascinated by Japanese culture, I was thrilled at the idea of trying authentic Japanese noodles, a dish so common yet so iconic in Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as we entered, the warm lighting, serene decor, and subtle aroma of spices welcomed us. The restaurant had an inviting ambiance, with bamboo accents and calming instrumental music that set the stage for a delightful evening.

          <p>That evening wasn't just about the food; it was about creating memories with my parents and siblings, trying something new, and laughing over our attempts to master chopsticks. It's one of those nights I'll always hold dear.</p>
           <p>To capture the moment, I recorded a short video of the restaurant's cozy ambiance and the beautiful dishes being served. Take a look:</p>
